Scenario 
When new students arrive at Tree Road School, they are assigned: 
● a unique ID number ● a tutor group ● a unique school email address
A tutor group contains approximately 25 male and female students. 
Mr Leeman is a form tutor and wants a simple computer system to manage his tutor group. 
Mr Leeman wants to be able to have a user friendly interface that allows him to log into the system and carry out the necessary administration. 
The details of the students that Mr Leeman needs are: 
● unique ID number 
● surname 
● forename 
● date of birth 
● home address 
● home phone number 
● gender ● tutor group 
● unique school email address.
Analyse the requirements for this system and design, develop, test and evaluate a program that allows Mr Leeman to: 
1. log in with a username and password 
2. access a menu system 
3. enter and store the students details 
4. log out 
5. retrieve and display the details of any student when Mr Leeman enters the student’s unique ID number.* 
6. create at least three different reports that Mr Leeman might need, and describe how he would use each one. 
7. produce these reports when selected from a menu.
*Note for candidates:
In order to test this program, you will need a data file containing the details of at least 25 students.
